        <p class="lead mb-5">My name is Peter and I currently reside in Darwin, Northern Territory. I am undertaking an ‘Introduction to Information technology’ as part of a degree in Information Technology at RMIT University.
         After a career in the Australian Defence force, I now work in the public service sector. Over my career, I have worked in several cities in the Northern Territory, including Katherine, Tennant Creek, and Alice Springs. I have held a senior position in the justice and public safety sector as a senior officer.
         When I am not glued to a computer screen, I enjoy practicing for marathons, going on hikes, and planning for the next adventure with the wife and kids.

          <div class="resume-content">
             <p>My passion for Information technology was introduced to me when I was a child. Credits go to my father who had bought my first computer when I was 8 years old. Games became my first experience with computers, and as I grew older, my interest expanded to cybersecurity, artificial intelligence and programming.</p>
<p>My interest in information technology has always been too deep to be fulfilled by school assignments alone. At some point, I realised that just playing games was not satisfying enough. I felt the need to explore and partake in another field was extremely important.</p>
<p>Working full time and studying can be quite daunting. From reading past student’s comments online, Batchelor of Information Technology in RMIT appears to be extremely flexible as the online system will give me the flexibility and support to study at a location and times during the week of my choosing.</p>
<p>I am hoping to increase my knowledge and skills through hands-on experience during this course. To work with others who have a wealth of experience in the field and to make long term connections with people.

 <div class="subheading mb-3">How should you take this into account when forming a team?</div>
       <p>When forming up a team, it is important to seek feedback from group members to identify strengths and weaknesses. It is necessary to hold a meeting in which members discuss what has gone well and what needs to improve. Having an understanding of personality types can prove useful in regard to how each member interacts with each other. A mix of knowledge and expertise on a team is important to achieve a set goal as it brings more diversity in skills and experience to bring a broader perspective and approaches to teamwork.

        <h2 class="mb-5">Project</h2>
         <div class="subheading mb-3">Overview</div>
       <p>A mobile game is a video game played on such devices as smartphones, tablets and any portable media player. This project aims to develop a game similar to flappy bird and implement an in-game feature to enhance the experience of the game to which the original game did not have.
</p>
       <div class="subheading mb-3">Motivation</div>
       <p>Thanks to their portability, mobile games are a perfect way to occupy free time while commuting, waiting in lines, or during other uninteresting routines.</p>
       <p>Games like Flappy birds were successful because of the highly addictive gameplay and the need to accomplish a set task to beat the previous score.</p>
       <p>I am hoping to create a game that is simple but yet challenging at the same time. The game will entail similar mechanics to Flappy bird and will be developed into a 2d retro-style graphics. The game will feature a main character with endless city level and flying objects which will become progressively harder.</p> 
       <p>The game aims to collect coins to purchase items to give the player an advantage or a better in-experience. These items consist of cosmetic, challengers, events, bonus levels and a character boost.</p> 
       <p>Each season new items will be created to allow users to customise their character as they wish. Loot box will be created will cost an x amount of coins to open and after the end of each season, the items in the mystery boxes are placed in the shop so that people can purchase them directly for a higher price.</p>
       <p>An in-game messaging system will allow users to invite friends into their “group ladder” to compare and post their daily results either by SMS or via an in-game message. 
The game will free to play but will contain advertisements as a means of revenue. These ads will be shown automatically in interval making them relatively unintrusive.
       </p>
        
        <div class="subheading mb-3">Description</div>
       <p>Every person these days has a mobile phone or tablet capable of playing games. Of the $109.8 billion in total revenue generated by digital games in 2018, mobile accounted for $61.3 billion. Gaming App downloads amount to around 21-25% of the total downloads. With many free mobile game development tools available, it is now easier to create a basic mobile game that is affordable without being an experienced game developer.</p>
